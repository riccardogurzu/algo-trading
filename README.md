# Algorithmic Trading & Market Microstructure Project
This project focuses on developing and analyzing a trend-following trading strategy using exponential moving averages (EMAs).

## Project Overview
The strategy implemented in this project captures market trends through the crossover of two EMAs. The core idea is to generate buy and sell signals based on the relative positions of a short-term EMA and a long-term EMA. Specifically:
- A buy signal is generated when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, indicating a potential upward trend.
- A sell signal is generated when the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA, indicating a potential downward trend.

### Objectives
1. **Develop a Trend-Following Strategy**: Implement a trading strategy that generates buy and sell signals based on EMA crossovers.
2. **Backtest the Strategy**: Evaluate the strategy's performance using historical market data.
3. **Analyze Results**: Conduct a thorough performance analysis to understand the strategy's effectiveness.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
The project begins with collecting historical price data for the assets of interest. The Yahoo Finance API, accessed through the `yfinance` library, is used to gather daily price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL). This dataset provides the foundation for the strategy's development and testing.

### Strategy Development
The strategy is centered around two EMAs:
- **Short-Term EMA**: Reacts quickly to price changes, providing early signals.
- **Long-Term EMA**: Reacts more slowly, helping to confirm longer-term trends.

The core principle of the strategy is:
- **Buy Signal**: When the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, indicating a potential upward trend.
- **Sell Signal**: When the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA, indicating a potential downward trend.

### Implementation Details
The strategy is implemented using `backtrader`, a Python library for backtesting trading strategies. A strategy class is defined to specify how and when buy or sell signals should be generated based on the EMA crossovers. This setup allows for systematic testing of the strategy against historical data.

### Backtesting the Strategy
Backtesting involves running the strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed in the past. This helps in understanding the potential risks and rewards of the strategy before applying it in a live trading environment. The EMA crossover strategy is backtested over a three-year period, from January 2020 to January 2023.

### Performance Analysis
To assess the strategy's performance, tools such as `quantstats` and `pyfolio` are used. These libraries provide a comprehensive suite of metrics and visualizations that help in evaluating the strategy's effectiveness. Key performance indicators such as return on investment, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and more are analyzed. This detailed analysis helps in understanding not only how profitable the strategy could be but also the associated risks and volatility.

## Results and Discussion
The backtesting results revealed that the EMA crossover strategy can be a valuable tool in trend-following scenarios. It effectively captured upward and downward trends, providing clear signals for entry and exit. However, like any trading strategy, it also had periods of underperformance, particularly in sideways or highly volatile markets.

The strategy's performance metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown, provided insights into its risk-adjusted returns. The analysis showed that while the strategy was able to generate positive returns, it also experienced significant drawdowns during market corrections.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using EMA crossovers in algorithmic trading to capture market trends. By leveraging historical data and backtesting, it is possible to evaluate the strategy's performance comprehensively. While the results are promising, it is important to consider the strategy's limitations and the need for continuous monitoring and adjustment in a live trading environment.
